# Decision-Tree
A decision tree is a tree structure (a binary tree or a non-binary tree). Each non-leaf node represents a test on a feature attribute. Each branch represents the output of a feature attribute in a certain value range, and each leaf node stores a category. To use the decision tree, start from the root node, test the feature attributes of the items to be classified, select the output branches, and use the category stored on the leaf node as the final result.
